#Simplexius: Simplex algorithme

A simplex algorithme implmentation

Entry example:
First select either min (for minimzation) ou max (maximization). Then past the objective function vector and its matrix on the indicated place int the UI. Like:

    4 5
    
    1 2 >= 6
    -1 3 >= 2
    7 1 >= 1
    
After you fill the fileds, click on `Calcular` go to your home and see inside `Simplexius` folder, on pdf you will see the resolution tableux step by step. The code is based on this book: [Programação Linear e Fluxo em Rede by Goldbar, Luna and Goldbar](http://www.saraiva.com.br/programacao-linear-e-fluxo-em-redes-8407595.html).
